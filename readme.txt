== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Find a complete documentation on <a href="http://creativejuiz.fr/blog/doc/juiz-social-post-sharer-documentation.html">this official documentation</a>

= Twitter counter doesn't appear OR the count seems to be not exact =
Yep, sorry about that, but <a href="https://twittercommunity.com/t/a-new-design-for-tweet-and-follow-buttons/52791">Twitter decided to shut down counter</a>.

Use the version 1.4.3 or more of this plugin to get an alternative of the native counter. But, keep in mind that alternative is not 100% precise, but better than nothing, I guess.

= The text shared by default is very ugly, something like "Share the post "YOUR POST TITLE" FacebookTwitterGoogle+E-mail [SOME OTHER WORDS]"? =
You certainly activated the buttons in the top of your post. It's your choice, but in this case, you need to improve by yourself the SEO-description of your article/page. You can try using the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/">WordPress SEO plugin by Yoast</a>. 

= Can I add a "Like" ou "Google +1" button with this plugin? =
Yes, but not with the page options of this plugin. You need to use a hook to add an item in your buttons list.
See the `juiz_sps_before_first_item` or `juiz_sps_after_last_item` hook in <a href="http://creativejuiz.fr/blog/doc/juiz-social-post-sharer-documentation.html">the documentation</a>. 

= I have a fatal error or a 500 server error since update to 1.2.3 =
Yes, you surely use pinterest button. It's a bug, update to 1.2.4.
Thank you.

= I can't just use shortcode by deactivating all the checkbox display option in admin option page? since 1.2.0 =
Yes, it's a bug, please, use the plugin version 1.2.2. 

= New style is not visible? =
Please update to 1.1.3

= Some options are not visible (if it's not the first installation, but an update of the plugin) =
Deactivate and reactivate the plugin to force the options rebuild.
