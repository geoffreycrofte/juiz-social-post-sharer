== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Find a complete documentation on <a href="https://sharebuttons.social/doc/?utm_source=wp-org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=faq">this official documentation</a>

= New 2.0.0 installed, weird stuff happens in my site =
Double check that you have saved your plugin settings (Settings > Nobs Share Buttons). Sometimes it happend, simply double check your settings and save.

= Since the update to 2.0.0, I don't have the same counters =
Indeed, because of brands like Facebook and Twitter shutting down their counters, a lot of data weren't accurate anymore. I decided to treat the counters as internal tool for your website. They are now YOUR counters and not facebook's or twitter's anymore.
Counterpart is that it now reset. No worries, a way to recover your old counters to add those to the new counters will come soon with 2.1.0 ;p

= Since the update to 2.0.0 my activated networks have changed =
Yes it can happen sometimes. 2.0.0 is a big update and the core of the plugin changed a lot. It's typically the only change you will notice, please just update your networks selected to the one you like, it shouldn't be an issue in the future.

= Why "Nobs"? What does that mean? =
Ha ha 😁 Good question.
Nobs stand for 3 different things:

1. "No BS" (AKA No Bullshit),
1. The humble accronym "Number One Button Set for Social Sharing" (Nobsss 😅 but I truncated it).
1. It's also a pun for "knobs", the actual buttons you find on your shirt or drawers. Thank you Myriam for the funny name.

= Twitter counter doesn't appear OR the count seems to be not exact =
Yep, sorry about that, but <a href="https://twittercommunity.com/t/a-new-design-for-tweet-and-follow-buttons/52791">Twitter decided to shut down counter</a> as well as Facebook.

Use the version 1.4.3 or above of this plugin to get an alternative of the native counter. But, keep in mind that alternative is not 100% precise, but better than nothing, I guess.

= The text shared by default is very ugly, something like "Share the post "YOUR POST TITLE" FacebookTwitterGoogle+E-mail [SOME OTHER WORDS]"? =
You certainly activated the buttons in the top of your post. It's your choice, but in this case, you need to improve by yourself the SEO-description of your article/page. You can try using the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/">WordPress SEO plugin by Yoast</a>. 

= Can I add a "Like" ou "Google +1" button with this plugin? =
Yes, but not with the page options of this plugin. You need to use a hook to add an item in your buttons list.
See the `juiz_sps_before_first_item` or `juiz_sps_after_last_item` hook in <a href="http://creativejuiz.fr/blog/doc/juiz-social-post-sharer-documentation.html">the documentation</a>. 

= I have a fatal error or a 500 server error since update to 1.2.3 =
Yes, you surely use pinterest button. It's a bug, update to 1.2.4 or above.
Thank you.

= I can't just use shortcode by deactivating all the checkbox display option in admin option page? since 1.2.0 =
Yes, it's a bug, please, use the plugin version 1.2.2 or above. 

= New style is not visible? =
Please update to 1.1.3 or above

= Some options are not visible (if it's not the first installation, but an update of the plugin) =
Deactivate and reactivate the plugin to force the rebuild of the options.
